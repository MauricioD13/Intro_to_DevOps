The objective of this project is to learn about DevOps tools, to benefit from automation, continous integration, continous delivery and IaC practices.

The first project is a FastAPI app with all the deployment process pseudo automated by using Ansible and Terraform:

- [An attack and Three tier solution](https://github.com/MauricioD13/Intro_to_DevOps/tree/main/Three_tier_terraform)

This will continue :)
